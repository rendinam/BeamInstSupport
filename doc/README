Subdirectories in this project area:
--------------------------------------

actions - Functions to obtain and prepare parameters for action 
               execution.
             Functions to actually perform a specific action using
               the results of the above.

          [Some actions result in a DSP command being executed,
           others have different remote or local effects as needed.]

BIP_input  - Input definition files for the BIParser program that 
             generates communication data structure header and code files.

cesr_intf - Routies for interfacing with the CESR MPM control system
            database.

cesr_intf_include - Headers for support of above interfacing routines

comm_code  - Auto-generated code for facilitating communications with 
             instruments

comm_include - Auto-generated headers for communication support

commstruct_output - Code for outputting variously formatted communcation
                    structure content.

communication - Various general purpose instrument communication
                functions

doc - Documentation

file_io - Mechanisms for configuration and data file input/output

hardware_include - Headers for specific register-level instrument
                   hardware support.

include - Collection of headers needed for this library

instrument_code - Code for the Analog Devices TigerSHARC DSP that resides
                  in each BPM instrument.

system - Memory setup and signal handling code for the DAQ and control library.

user_io - Routines to facilitate user interaction with the control application.

utils  - Sundry utility functions for data value/format 
             manipulation, keyboard input, and status setting/display.
